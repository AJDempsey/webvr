      Set up VR scene

      This will contain every entity in the scene, handles all the 3D
      (all the things that three.js deals with, canvas, camera, lights,
      renderer, renderloop) quite a lot of heavy lifting!

      <!--
        Adding objects

        Objects can be added either using the base object <a-entity> and filling
        in all the components ourself or by using the premitives that a-frame
        provides. Things like <a-box>, <a-cylinder> etc.
        See documentation:
        primitives: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/docs/primitives
        entity: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/core/entity.md
      -->
      <a-box color="red"></a-box>
      <a-entity id="test-box" geometry="primitive: box" material="color: red">
      </a-entity>

      <!--
        3D space in a-frame

        Coordinate system for a-frame uses a right hand coordinate system.
        + x-axis extends to the right (thumb)
        + y-axis extends upwards (index)
        + z-axis extends out of the screen (middle)
        Distance is measured in meters (remember this when developing)
        Rotation is measured in degrees (positive direction is found by
          pointing the right thumb along the +ve axis and the finger curl
          is the positive direction)
        An entity is placed in the world using the position, rotation, and scale
        components.

        Without these components the position defaults to (0,0,0), given this the
        above boxes exist at the same place as the default camera. To view the
        boxes we need to either move around or move the boxes. We'll create a new
        entity and display it where we can see from the start.
      -->
      <a-box position="0 0.90 -10" rotation="0 45 45" scale="2 4 2" color="blue">
        <a-sphere position"1 0 3" color="black" material="wireframe: true"></a-sphere>
      </a-box>
      <!-- The above demonstrates inheretance of translations -->

      <!--
        Adding images as textures

        It's possible to apply an image to an entity by using the src attribute.
        Any colour the entity has will get blended into the texture. Default colour is
        white so just removing the colour attribute is enough.
        This isn't the most performant, instead use the asset management system.

      -->
      <a-box src="https://i.imgur.com/mYmmbrp.jpg" position="5 2 -5" rotation="0 -45 45"
        scale="2 2 2"></a-box>

      <!--
        Asset management

        While you can directly link to textures it's not recommended, instead
        use asset management systems instead. This makes it easier for the
        browser to cache assets, and a-frame will be able to fetch resources
        before rendering.
      -->
      <a-assets>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mYmmbrp.jpg" id="testAsset">
      </a-assets>

      <a-box id="assetBox" src="#testAsset" position="-5 2 -5"

      </a-box>

      <a-entity environment="preset: forest; dressingAmount: 500"></a-entity>
      <!--
        Custom environments

        Instead of importing an environment it's possible to build environments
        from primitives, I wont replace the environment but I'lll add the code
        to this comment.

        The Sky
        <a-sky color="#222"></a-sky>

        This will set the background of the scene to a certain color. The sky
        is the inside of a large sphere. It can also be set to a 360 video or
        image (use an asset for this and the src attribute)

        The Ground
        <a-plane src="#groundAsset" rotation="-90 0 0 width="30" height="30"
          repeat="10 10"></a-plane>

        The ground is created using a plane. By default a plane is parallel to
        the XY axis, rotate 90 degree in negative X axis to make it to parallel
        to the XZ axis. Make it large using the width and height attributes and
        repeat the texture (how many times in the X and Y direction)

        Lighting
        To create lighting use the <a-light> entity, there's multiple different
        types of lights they match with the three.js lights.
        By default a-frame provides ligthing for the scene (otherwise it would
        be dark) when we add <a-light> to the scene a-frame removes the default
        light sources.

        <a-light type="ambient" color="#445457"></a-light>
        <a-light type="point" intensity="2" position="2 4 4"></a-light>

        Combining these primitives and more will allow you to build your own
        environments. I'll stick with the prefab just now.

      <!--
        Annimations

        We can add animations to an element by placing <a-animation> element
        as a child.
        Animations interpolate, or tween, a value over time.
        Here the animation works on the position attribute, animating to -5 2.2 -5
        (twenty cm higher) alternating the direction every cycle, with each cycles
        duration lasting 2000ms and repeats forever.
      -->
      <a-animation id="bounceAnnimation" attributes="position"
                                         to="-5 2.2 -5"
                                         direction="alternate"
                                         dur="2000"
                                         repeat="indefinite">
      </a-animation>
      <!-- add to an existing box instead of cluttering up the scene.
          bad practice? Probably.-->
      <script>
        document.getElementById("assetBox").appendChild(document.getElementById("bounceAnnimation"))
      </script>

        Cursor and Camera

        To create interactions we can use a cursor on mobile and desktop.
        This allows us to "click" on things in mobile using our gaze and using
        the mouse on desktop.
        To create a cursor attached to the camera we need to override the
        default cursor that a-frame provides and add the cursor as a child of
        the camera
      -->

        <a-cursor color="white"></a-cursor>
