      Set up VR scene

      This will contain every entity in the scene, handles all the 3D
      (all the things that three.js deals with, canvas, camera, lights,
      renderer, renderloop) quite a lot of heavy lifting!

    <!--
      Adding objects

      Objects can be added either using the base object <a-entity> and filling
      in all the components ourself or by using the premitives that a-frame
      provides. Things like <a-box>, <a-cylinder> etc.
      See documentation:
      primitives: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/docs/primitives
      entity: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/core/entity.md
    -->
    <a-box color="red"></a-box>
    <a-entity id="test-box" geometry="primitive: box" material="color: red">
    </a-entity>

      3D space in a-frame

      Coordinate system for a-frame uses a right hand coordinate system.
      + x-axis extends to the right (thumb)
      + y-axis extends upwards (index)
      + z-axis extends out of the screen (middle)
      Distance is measured in meters (remember this when developing)
      Rotation is measured in degrees (positive direction is found by
        pointing the right thumb along the +ve axis and the finger curl
        is the positive direction)
      An entity is placed in the world using the position, rotation, and scale
      components.

      Without these components the position defaults to (0,0,0), given this the
      above boxes exist at the same place as the default camera. To view the
      boxes we need to either move around or move the boxes. We'll create a new
      entity and display it where we can see from the start.

    <a-box position="0 2 -10" rotation="0 45 45" scale="2 4 2" color="blue">
      <a-sphere position"1 0 3" color="black" material="wireframe: true"></a-sphere>
    </a-box>
