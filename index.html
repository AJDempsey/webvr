      Set up VR scene

      This will contain every entity in the scene, handles all the 3D
      (all the things that three.js deals with, canvas, camera, lights,
      renderer, renderloop) quite a lot of heavy lifting!
    -->
    <a-scene>
      <!--
        Adding objects

        Objects can be added either using the base object <a-entity> and filling
        in all the components ourself or by using the premitives that a-frame
        provides. Things like <a-box>, <a-cylinder> etc.
        See documentation:
        primitives: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/docs/primitives
        entity: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/core/entity.md
      -->
      <a-box color="red"></a-box>
      <a-entity id="test-box" geometry="primitive: box" material="color: red">
      </a-entity>

      <!--
        3D space in a-frame

        Coordinate system for a-frame uses a right hand coordinate system.
        + x-axis extends to the right (thumb)
        + y-axis extends upwards (index)
        + z-axis extends out of the screen (middle)
        Distance is measured in meters (remember this when developing)
        Rotation is measured in degrees (positive direction is found by
          pointing the right thumb along the +ve axis and the finger curl
          is the positive direction)
        An entity is placed in the world using the position, rotation, and scale
        components.

        Without these components the position defaults to (0,0,0), given this the
        above boxes exist at the same place as the default camera. To view the
        boxes we need to either move around or move the boxes. We'll create a new
        entity and display it where we can see from the start.
      -->
      <a-box position="0 0.90 -10" rotation="0 45 45" scale="2 4 2" color="blue">
        <a-sphere position"1 0 3" color="black" material="wireframe: true"></a-sphere>
      </a-box>
      <!-- The above demonstrates inheretance of translations -->

      <!--
        Adding images as textures

        It's possible to apply an image to an entity by using the src attribute.
        Any colour the entity has will get blended into the texture. Default colour is
        white so just removing the colour attribute is enough.
        This isn't the most performant, instead use the asset management system.

      -->
      <a-box src="https://i.imgur.com/mYmmbrp.jpg" position="5 2 -5" rotation="0 -45 45"
        scale="2 2 2"></a-box>

      <!--
        Asset management

        While you can directly link to textures it's not recommended, instead
        use asset management systems instead. This makes it easier for the
        browser to cache assets, and a-frame will be able to fetch resources
        before rendering.
      -->
      <a-assets>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mYmmbrp.jpg" id="testAsset">
      </a-assets>

      <a-box src="#testAsset" position="-5 2 -5" rotation="0 -45 45" scale="2 2 2">
      </a-box>

      <a-entity environment="preset: forest; dressingAmount: 500"></a-entity>
